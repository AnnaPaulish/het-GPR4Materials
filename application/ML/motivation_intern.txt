I graduated in mathematics, which gave me a solid theoretical foundation. I then moved to a more applied Computational Science and Engineering program at EPFL where I improved my computational skills by taking a range of courses in data science and computer science.
During my studies, I already had many opportunities to sharpen my skills not only in the classroom but also with various experiences in research labs and internships. Throughout my career, I have been constantly interested in exploring the applications of 
mathematical tools in various fields such as crystallography, neuroscience, biology, and material science. 
I believe that Google plays a crucial role in shaping technological advancements and 
I am very inspired to apply my diverse research experience and solid background to contribute to the reseach 
in industrial world on a global scale.
